<span class="dropcap">T</span>his is a test post to see what generic text looks like. I would use lorem but typing out actual copy is significantly more useful for testing.

This is what the second paragraph looks like. Not very exciting, but it gets the job done. Now whats see what things will look like when I want to create a section of code:

###### This is a sample code section
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
(function() {
    console.log('hello world');
})(); 
{% endhighlight %}

Let's add a few more paragraphs in here. Maybe this paragraph is describing the code above. Maybe it is explaining why it is bad. Let's see what a list would look like:

* Comment 1    
* Comment 2
  * Comment a
  * Comment b
* Comment 3

Now let's say that I want to highlight a small amount of text with a blockquote. Everyone loves blockquotes!

>this is a blockquote

##Why not some subheadings too?

This is content that deserved to be segregated below a subheading. Why? Well that I don't know. With the time it took me to write up all this dummy text I could have written an actual post (not really)

###Wow that horizontal rule looks fancy!

And another paragraph to wrap things up. Lets test out the other text styles! *This is italic text. It is imported from Italy*. **This is bold test. It is imported from nowhere.**

Well that was silly. Let's wrap things up.
